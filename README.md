# heart_monitor_flutter

I created a heart rate monitoring mobile app using Dart, which included integration with a heart rate sensor for real-time monitoring. I designed an intuitive user interface that displays heart rate data and graphs, and provides alerts for irregularities based on photoplethysmography, a commonly used heart monitoring technique, resulting in an optimal user experience.
